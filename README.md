# Web View Wrapper for Rave by Flutterwave(https://rave.flutterwave.com/)
A web view wrapper for Flutterwave Rave payment gateway with support for React Native v0.60 and doesn't require any react native linking.

This package allows you plug-in Rave's payment gateway directly into your react native application and start accepting payment immediately.

This package copies a similar loading design to that of Rave, which makes transistion to Rave's website less noticeable. This package also offers a cancel button, so one can easily cancel if Rave takes a long time to load its content (the ``` onCancel ``` props event is called when this happens).

### Compatibility
|`@react-native-community/cli` |`react-native`|
| --| --|
|[^1.0.0](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/tree/1.x) |^0.59.0|


### Integrating Rave React Native

You can pull in @nipek/react-native-rave-webview into app with the steps below;

-   Change directory into your current project directory from your terminal and enter this command:

    > npm install @nipek/react-native-rave-webview --save

## Usage

#### [](https://github.com/nipek/react-native-rave-webview#1--import-rave-component)1. import Rave Component

    import {RaveWebView} from '@nipek/react-native-rave-webview';

 #### 2. Set your success, failure and close methods



    constructor(props) {
        super(props);

      }

      onSuccess(data) {
        console.log("success", data);
        // You get the complete response returned from FlutterWave,
        // just incase you need more than the reference number

      }

      onCancel() {
        console.log("error", 'Transaction was Cancelled!');
      }

      onError() {
        //an error occoured

      }
#### 3. Use component (ensure to set currency for the desired payment method to display)



     render() {
         return (
            <View  style={styles.container}>
              <RaveWebView
                raveKey="<your-api-key-here>"
                amount={20000}
                customerEmail={"olanipekunifeoluwao@gmail.com"}
                customerPhone={"09030841956"}
                billingEmail="olanipekunifeoluwao@gmail.com (optional)"
                billingMobile="09030841956 (optional)"
                billingName="Olanipekun Ifeoluwa (optional but advised)"
                ActivityIndicatorColor="black"
                onCancel={this.onCancel}
                onSuccess={this.onSuccess}
                onError={() => { alert('something went wrong') }}
                txref="<your-autogenerated-transaction-reference>"
              />
            </View>
	    );
	   }
